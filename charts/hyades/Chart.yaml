  Hyades is an incubating project for decoupling responsibilities from Dependency-Track's
  monolithic API server into separate, scalable services. It will eventually become
  Dependency-Track version 5. HYADES IS NOT CONSIDERED GENERALLY AVAILABLE YET,
  and breaking changes may be introduced without prior notice. Use this chart
  locally or in test environments, but don't rely on it in production yet.
  The GA roadmap for Hyades is tracked here: https://github.com/DependencyTrack/hyades/issues/860
